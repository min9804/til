## There Will be Code.
- We will never be rid of code, because code represents the details of the requirements. At some level those details cannot be ignored or abstracted; they have to be specified.
- I expect that the level of abstraction of our languages and domain-specific languages will continue to increase. But it will not dliminate code.
- It will still need to be rigorous, accurate, and so formal and detailed that a macchine can understand and execute it.
