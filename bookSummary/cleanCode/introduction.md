# Chapter 00 - introduction

***

Learning to write clean code is wardwork. 
It requires more than just the kowledge of principles and patterns.



This book into three parts.

1. Describe the principls, patterns, and practices of writhing clean code.

    There is quit a bit of code in these chapters, and they will be challenging to read.
    
    
    
2. The harder work.

    It consists of several case studies of ever-increasing complexity.
    Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up sone code-of transforming codd that has some provlems 
    into code that has fewer problems



3. Payoff 

    I is a single chapter containing a lst of heuristics and smells gathered while creating the case studies.
