## There Will be Code. ##

- We will never be rid of code, because code represents the details of the requirements. At some level those details cannot be ignored or abstracted; they have to be specified.
- I expect that the level of abstraction of our languages and domain-specific languages will continue to increase. But it will not dliminate code.
- It will still need to be rigorous, accurate, and so formal and detailed that a macchine can understand and execute it.

## Bad Code ##

- There's a one company that wrote a killer app. But this company was brought down because dos not managed bad code
- If you are a programmer, you will have experience of neglecting bad codes to meet your schedule and thinking, "I'll clean up my bad code later"
- We've all said we'd go back and clean it up later. Of course, in those days we didn't know LeBlanc's law: Later equals never.

## The Total Cost of Owning a Mess ##

- Over the span of a year or two, teams that were moving vary gast at the beginning of porject can find themselves moving at a snail's pace
  - Every addition or modification to the system requires that the tangles, twists, and knots ve "understood" so that more tangles, twists, and knots can ve added.
  - Over time the mess becomes so bif and so deep and so tall, they can not clean it up. There is no way at all
