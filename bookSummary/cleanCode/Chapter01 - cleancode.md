## There Will be Code. ##

- We will never be rid of code, because code represents the details of the requirements. At some level those details cannot be ignored or abstracted; they have to be specified.
</br>

- I expect that the level of abstraction of our languages and domain-specific languages will continue to increase. But it will not dliminate code.
</br>

- It will still need to be rigorous, accurate, and so formal and detailed that a macchine can understand and execute it.

## Bad Code ##

- There's a one company that wrote a killer app. But this company was brought down because dos not managed bad code
</br>

- If you are a programmer, you will have experience of neglecting bad codes to meet your schedule and thinking, "I'll clean up my bad code later"
</br>

- We've all said we'd go back and clean it up later. Of course, in those days we didn't know LeBlanc's law: Later equals never.

## The Total Cost of Owning a Mess ##

- Over the span of a year or two, teams that were moving vary gast at the beginning of porject can find themselves moving at a snail's pace
  - Every addition or modification to the system requires that the tangles, twists, and knots ve "understood" so that more tangles, twists, and knots can ve added.
  - Over time the mess becomes so big and so deep and so tall, they can not clean it up. There is no way at all
  </br>
  
- As the mess vuilds, the productivity of the team continues to decreas, asymptotically approaching zero.
- As profuctivity dereases, management dos the only thing they can: 
 - they add more staff to the project in hopes of increasing productivity.
 - But that new staff is not versed in the design of the system.
 - Furthermore, they, and eeryone else on the team, are under horrific pressure to increase productivity. 
 - So they all make more and more messes, driving the productivity ever further toward zero.
